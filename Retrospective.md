## Experience

A bit more challenging than expected, especially towards the end. The introduction of pug as a way to simplify html was rather useful, more easy on the eyes.


## Known issues or Bugs

On my end, I am unable to view css changes other than that of the body in my site.

## Sources used

A friend to help.
